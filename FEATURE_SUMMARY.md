# Feature Enhancement Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. âœ… Line Width Increased by 300%
- **Before:** `lineWidth = 2`
- **After:** `lineWidth = 6` (defined as constant `DotsAndBoxesGame.LINE_WIDTH`)
- Lines are now much more visible and easier to see on all screen sizes

### 2. âœ… Persistent Line Colors
- **Issue:** Lines were changing to red after each player's turn
- **Solution:** Added `lineOwners` Map to permanently track which player drew each line
- **Implementation:**
  - `this.lineOwners.set(lineKey, this.currentPlayer)` when line is drawn
  - `getLinePlayer()` now uses stored ownership instead of temporary pulsating array
- Lines now maintain their original player's color for the entire game

### 3. âœ… Multiple Kiss Emoji Animations
- **Before:** Single ðŸ’‹ emoji per completed square
- **After:** 20-35 randomly placed ðŸ’‹ emojis per square
- **Features:**
  - Random positioning within 2Ã— cell size radius
  - Staggered start times (0-200ms delay)
  - Varied durations (1000-1500ms)
  - Varied scales (0.5-1.0)
  - Floating upward with sideways wobble animation

### 4. âœ… Score Multiplier System

#### Distribution (Randomly assigned to all squares)
- **x2 multipliers:** 60% of squares
- **x3 multipliers:** 20% of squares
- **x4 multipliers:** 10% of squares
- **x5 multipliers:** 5% of squares
- **x10 multipliers:** 1% of squares
- **Truth or Dare cards:** Remaining ~4% of squares

#### Implementation Details
- `initializeMultipliers()` generates distribution after grid setup
- Multipliers revealed when player clicks/taps completed square
- Cannot reveal same square twice (tracked in `revealedMultipliers` Set)
- Both mouse and touch events supported

#### Visual Effects
- **Multiplier reveal:** Golden text with "x2", "x3", etc.
- **Sparks:** 30 golden particles shooting outward
- **Smoke:** 10 gray particles rising upward
- **Animation:** 2-second reveal with scale and fade

#### Scoring
- Multipliers add bonus points: `score += (multiplier - 1)`
- Example: x2 multiplier adds 1 point, x5 adds 4 points

### 5. âœ… Animated Score Counter
- Scores count up smoothly instead of jumping
- `displayedScores` tracks current animation value
- Updates continuously in `animate()` loop
- `scoreAnimationSpeed = 0.1` controls counting speed
- Score display includes golden glow effect (CSS `text-shadow`)

### 6. âœ… Code Audit & Optimizations

#### Constants Added
All magic numbers extracted to static class constants:
- `DOT_RADIUS = 1.6`
- `LINE_WIDTH = 6`
- `CELL_SIZE_MIN = 8`, `CELL_SIZE_MAX = 40`
- `GRID_OFFSET = 20`
- Animation durations (600-2000ms)
- Particle counts (15-30)
- Kiss emoji ranges (20-35)

#### Helper Methods Added
- `parseLineKey(lineKey)` - Converts "row,col-row,col" to dot objects
- `parseSquareKey(squareKey)` - Converts "row,col" to {row, col}

**Impact:** Eliminates redundant string parsing in draw loops (performance improvement)

#### Audit Findings
- âœ… No critical bottlenecks found
- âœ… All animation arrays properly cleaned up
- âœ… Memory management excellent
- âœ… Conditional rendering prevents unnecessary draws
- See `CODE_AUDIT.md` for full report

## Testing Results

### Grid Sizes Tested
- âœ… **10x10:** 91 squares, all features working
- âœ… **20x20:** 364 squares, landscape mode (29Ã—14), all features working
- âœ… **30x30:** Not tested in this session but architecture supports it

### Feature Verification
- âœ… Line width visibly thicker (6px vs 2px)
- âœ… Line colors persist throughout game
- âœ… Multiple kiss emojis spawn on square completion
- âœ… Multipliers properly distributed and revealed
- âœ… Sparks and smoke effects on multiplier reveal
- âœ… Score counter animates smoothly
- âœ… Touch and mouse events both work
- âœ… No console errors
