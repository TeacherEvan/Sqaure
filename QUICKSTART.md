# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Get Playing in 30 Seconds!

### Fastest Way (No Installation)
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Select a grid size (10×10, 20×20, or 30×30)
3. Choose player colors (optional)
4. Click "Start Game"
5. **Play!** Click dots to connect them

### Slightly Fancier Way (Local Server)
```bash
# If you have Node.js:
npm start

# If you have Python:
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🎮 Basic Controls

### Mouse
- **Click** a dot to select it (you'll see a colored ring)
- **Click** an adjacent dot to draw a line
- Complete a square to score a point and get another turn!

### Touch (Mobile/Tablet)
- **Tap** dots just like clicking with a mouse
- Works great in landscape mode!

## 🏆 Game Rules (Super Simple)

1. **Players alternate** drawing lines between adjacent dots
2. **Complete a square** by drawing its 4th side = you score!
3. **Bonus**: Complete a square, get another turn
4. **Win**: Have the most squares when the grid is full

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Plan ahead** - Try not to give your opponent easy squares
- **Control the endgame** - Be strategic about which squares to complete
- **Double-crosses** - Look for patterns where you can complete multiple squares in one turn
- **Landscape mode** - Rotate your device for the best experience on mobile

## 🎨 Customization

Change player colors on the welcome screen:
- **Player 1**: Red by default (top left)
- **Player 2**: Blue by default (top right)

## 📱 Best Experience

- **Desktop**: Any modern browser, works great!
- **Mobile**: Use landscape orientation for optimal layout
- **Grid Size**: 
  - 10×10 for quick games (2-3 minutes)
  - 20×20 for medium games (5-10 minutes)  
  - 30×30 for epic battles (15+ minutes)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Dots not showing?**
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled

**Game too small/big?**
- Try fullscreen mode (should auto-trigger)
- Resize your browser window and the game adapts

**Touch not working?**
- Make sure you're tapping directly on dots
- Try landscape orientation

## 🎯 That's It!

You're ready to play! The game is intuitive - just start connecting dots and you'll get the hang of it in seconds.

**Have fun!** 🎮✨
