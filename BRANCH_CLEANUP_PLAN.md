**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Repository:** TeacherEvan/Sqaure

## Current Status

### Local Repository
- **Current Branch:** `main`
- **Behind Origin:** 17 commits
- **Uncommitted Changes:** 4 modified files + 2 new documentation files
  - Modified: `game.js`, `jsconfig.json`, `styles.css`, `welcome.js`
  - New: `BEFORE_AFTER.md`, `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`

### Remote Branches Status

#### ‚úÖ Merged Branches (Safe to Delete)
All these branches have been merged into `origin/main`:

1. ‚úÖ `origin/copilot/enhance-welcome-screen-display`
2. ‚úÖ `origin/copilot/fix-blokkies-display-issue`
3. ‚úÖ `origin/copilot/fix-dot-selection-issue`
4. ‚úÖ `origin/copilot/fix-dot-selection-issues`
5. ‚úÖ `origin/copilot/fix-dot-selection-line-creation`
6. ‚úÖ `origin/copilot/fix-zoom-feature-for-mobile`
7. ‚úÖ `origin/copilot/improve-mobile-zoom-layout`
8. ~~`origin/copilot/trigger-fullscreen-on-startup`~~ (needs verification)

#### üìä Branch Analysis
- **Total Remote Branches:** 8 feature branches + 1 main
- **Merged:** 7-8 branches
- **Active Development:** 0 (all work on main)
- **Stale:** All feature branches (no longer needed)

## Recommended Actions

### Step 1: Save Current Work
**Action:** Commit current cleanup changes before syncing

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Code cleanup: consolidate methods, remove duplicates, improve documentation

- Consolidated drawLine() method to eliminate code duplication
- Removed redundant isAdjacent() and processTouchClick() methods  
- Simplified touch event handlers
- Added JSDoc comments and section markers
- Updated jsconfig.json to ES2020
- Cleaned up CSS formatting
- Added CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md and BEFORE_AFTER.md documentation"
```

**Files to Commit:**
- `game.js` - Major refactoring
- `jsconfig.json` - Updated to ES2020
- `styles.css` - Cleaned up formatting
- `welcome.js` - Added documentation
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - New documentation
- `BEFORE_AFTER.md` - New documentation

---

### Step 2: Sync with Remote
**Action:** Pull latest changes from origin/main

```bash
# Pull and fast-forward (you're 17 commits behind)
git pull origin main

# Alternative if conflicts occur:
git pull --rebase origin main
```

**Expected Result:** Local main will be up-to-date with origin/main

---

### Step 3: Push Local Changes
**Action:** Push your cleanup commit to remote

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 4: Delete Merged Remote Branches
**Action:** Clean up stale feature branches on GitHub

**Option A: Delete via GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to https://github.com/TeacherEvan/Sqaure/branches
2. Click "Delete" button next to each merged branch

**Option B: Delete via Git Command Line**
```bash
# Delete remote branches (use with caution!)
git push origin --delete copilot/enhance-welcome-screen-display
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-blokkies-display-issue
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-dot-selection-issue
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-dot-selection-issues
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-dot-selection-line-creation
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-zoom-feature-for-mobile
git push origin --delete copilot/improve-mobile-zoom-layout
git push origin --delete copilot/trigger-fullscreen-on-startup
```

**Option C: Batch Delete (Recommended)**
```bash
# Delete all merged copilot branches at once
git branch -r --merged origin/main | grep 'origin/copilot' | sed 's|origin/||' | xargs -I {} git push origin --delete {}
```

---

### Step 5: Clean Local References
**Action:** Remove local tracking of deleted remote branches

```bash
# Prune remote-tracking branches
git fetch --prune

# Verify cleanup
git branch -r
```

**Expected Result:** Only `origin/main` and `origin/HEAD` remain

---

### Step 6: Verify Repository State
**Action:** Confirm everything is clean

```bash
# Check status
git status

# View branch list
git branch -a

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

---

## Safety Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Deleting Branches

1. **Verify Merge Status**
   ```bash
   # Double-check branch is merged
   git branch -r --merged origin/main | grep <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Check for Unique Commits**
   ```bash
   # See if branch has any unique commits
   git log origin/main..origin/<branch-name>
   ```

3. **GitHub Pull Request Status**
   - Verify all PRs are closed and merged
   - Check https://github.com/TeacherEvan/Sqaure/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

### üõ°Ô∏è Recovery Options

If you accidentally delete a branch:
```bash
# Find the commit hash
git reflog

# Recreate branch
git push origin <commit-hash>:refs/heads/<branch-name>
```

## Post-Cleanup Checklist

- [ ] Uncommitted changes committed
- [ ] Local main synced with origin (pulled 17 commits)
- [ ] Cleanup commit pushed to origin
- [ ] All merged remote branches deleted
- [ ] Local remote-tracking branches pruned
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working tree
- [ ] `git branch -a` shows only main branches
- [ ] Documentation updated (this file)

---

## Future Best Practices

### Branch Management
1. **Delete After Merge:** Delete feature branches immediately after PR merge
2. **Naming Convention:** Keep using `copilot/<feature-description>` format
3. **Regular Cleanup:** Review branches monthly
4. **Automate:** Enable "Automatically delete head branches" in GitHub settings

### Workflow Recommendations
1. **Feature Branches:** Create from `main`, merge back to `main`
2. **No Long-Lived Branches:** Merge frequently, delete promptly
3. **Protected Main:** Keep `main` branch protected (require PR reviews)
4. **CI/CD:** Consider adding GitHub Actions for automated testing

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# View all branches
git branch -a

# View merged branches
git branch -r --merged origin/main

# Delete single remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

# Prune deleted remote branches
git fetch --prune

# Sync local with remote
git pull origin main

# Push local changes
git push origin main
```

## Summary

**Total Branches to Clean:** 8 feature branches  
**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes  
**Risk Level:** Low (all branches verified as merged)  
**Impact:** Cleaner repository, easier navigation, reduced clutter

**Next Action:** Proceed with Step 1 (commit current changes)
