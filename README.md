|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 10×10     | 10×10 grid  | ~16×7 grid      | 81 squares    |
| 20×20     | 20×20 grid  | ~33×14 grid     | 361 squares   |
| 30×30     | 30×30 grid  | ~50×18 grid     | 841 squares   |

*Landscape mode activates when aspect ratio > 1.5

## 🎯 How to Play

### Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Complete more squares than your opponent
2. **Turns**: Players alternate drawing lines between adjacent dots
3. **Scoring**: Complete a square by drawing its fourth side to earn a point
4. **Bonus Turn**: Complete a square to earn another turn immediately
5. **Winning**: Player with the most squares when the grid is full wins

### Controls

- **Mouse**: Click dots to select and connect them
- **Touch**: Tap dots on touchscreen devices
- **Selection**: Click a dot, then click an adjacent dot to draw a line
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected dot shows a colored ring

### Strategy Tips

- Plan ahead to avoid giving opponents easy squares
- Try to complete multiple squares in one turn
- Control the endgame by managing available moves
- Watch for "double-cross" patterns

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### DotsAndBoxesGame Class (`game.js`)

- **State Management**: Lines (Set), Squares (Object), Scores (Object)
- **Rendering Engine**: HTML5 Canvas with 60fps animation loop
- **Event Handling**: Mouse, touch, and resize events
- **Game Logic**: Square detection, turn management, win conditions

#### Key Methods

```javascript
setupCanvas()          // Adaptive layout calculation
getNearestDot()       // Collision detection for dot selection
checkForSquares()     // Square completion detection
draw()                // Main rendering loop
animate()             // Animation frame management
```

### Data Structures

#### Line Keys (Normalized)

```javascript
"1,2-1,3"  // Horizontal line from (1,2) to (1,3)
"1,2-2,2"  // Vertical line from (1,2) to (2,2)
```

Always sorted to prevent duplicates.

#### Square Keys

```javascript
"5,10"  // Square at row 5, column 10
```

### Coordinate System

```javascript
screenX = offsetX + col × cellSize
screenY = offsetY + row × cellSize
```

- Origin: Top-left corner
- Grid: 0-indexed rows and columns

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Grid Sizes

Edit `index.html` to add new grid size buttons:

```html
<button class="grid-btn" data-size="40">40×40</button>
```

### Adjusting Visual Properties

In `game.js` constructor:

```javascript
this.dotRadius = 1.6;    // Dot size
this.lineWidth = 1;      // Line thickness
this.cellSize = 8-40;    // Cell size range (calculated)
```

### Color Schemes

Default colors can be changed in `index.html`:

```html
<input type="color" id="player1Color" value="#FF0000">
<input type="color" id="player2Color" value="#0000FF">
```
