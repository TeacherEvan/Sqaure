   ```

3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Test thoroughly** across different browsers
5. **Commit with clear messages**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: feature description"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**

7. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots/GIFs for visual changes

## üìã Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, classes)
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

### Code Structure

```javascript
// Good: Clear, focused function
function calculateGridDimensions(aspectRatio, gridSize) {
    const cols = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(gridSize * aspectRatio));
    const rows = Math.ceil(gridSize / cols);
    return { cols, rows };
}

// Avoid: Doing too much in one function
function doEverything() {
    // ... 200 lines of code
}
```

### Canvas Drawing

- Always clear canvas before redrawing
- Use `beginPath()` before drawing shapes
- Set styles before drawing
- Use `save()` and `restore()` for temporary state changes

### Event Handling

- Bind event handlers in constructor or setup
- Remove event listeners when cleaning up
- Use `passive: false` for touch events that prevent default
