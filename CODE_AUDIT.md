# Code Audit Report

## Overview
- Total Lines: 1258 lines in game.js
- Language: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- No build process or dependencies

## Performance Analysis

### 1. Animation Loop (animate() method)
**Current Implementation:**
- Uses requestAnimationFrame continuously
- Conditional rendering based on active animations
- **GOOD:** Only redraws when necessary

**Optimization Opportunity:**
- Consider pausing animation loop when no animations are active
- Currently checks multiple arrays on every frame

### 2. Drawing Operations

**Potential Bottleneck Areas:**

#### a. Line Drawing (draw() method)
```javascript
for (const lineKey of this.lines) {
    // Parse line key on every draw
    const [start, end] = lineKey.split('-').map(s => {
        const [row, col] = s.split(',').map(Number);
        return { row, col };
    });
    // ... drawing code
}
```
**Issue:** String parsing happens on every frame
**Suggestion:** Cache parsed line positions

#### b. Square Drawing (drawSquaresWithAnimations())
- Iterates through all squares on every draw
- Performs string splitting for coordinates
**Suggestion:** Pre-compute positions during square completion

#### c. Particle System
- Each particle checked individually for decay
- Math operations on every particle every frame
**Current Status:** ACCEPTABLE - particles are short-lived

### 3. Event Handlers

**Touch Event Processing:**
- Multiple touch event handlers with similar logic
- Debouncing implemented (GOOD)
- Distance calculations repeated in multiple places

**Mouse Event Processing:**
- Proper debouncing to prevent conflicts with touch
- Distance calculation in getNearestDot is efficient

### 4. Memory Management

**Arrays that grow over time:**
- `this.pulsatingLines` - Cleaned every 2 seconds ✓
- `this.squareAnimations` - Cleaned after duration ✓
- `this.particles` - Filtered on decay ✓
- `this.kissEmojis` - Cleaned after duration ✓
- `this.multiplierAnimations` - Cleaned after duration ✓
- `this.truthOrDareAnimations` - Cleaned after duration ✓

**Status:** GOOD - All temporary arrays are properly cleaned

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Redundant Code

#### A. Duplicate Coordinate Parsing
Multiple places parse string keys like "row,col":
- Line 635: Drawing squares
- Line 609: Drawing lines
- Line 212: checkForSquares
- Line 529: triggerSquareAnimation

**Recommendation:** Create helper method `parseSquareKey(key)` and `parseLineKey(key)`

#### B. Repeated Distance Calculations
Distance to dot calculated in:
- getNearestDot()
- handleTouchEnd()
- getSquareAtPosition() (could benefit from similar logic)

**Status:** ACCEPTABLE - Each serves different purpose

### 2. Magic Numbers

Found several magic numbers that could be constants:
- Line width: 6 (now increased from 2)
- Dot radius: 1.6
- Cell size range: 8-40
- Animation durations: 600, 1000, 2000
- Particle counts: 15, 30
- Kiss emoji count: 20-35
- Offset: 20

**Recommendation:** Define as named constants at top of class

### 3. Code Organization

**Current Structure:** Mostly well-organized
- Constructor sets up state
- Methods grouped logically
- Drawing methods separated

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- Consider splitting into separate files:
  - game-core.js (game logic)
  - game-rendering.js (drawing)
  - game-animations.js (particle/animation systems)

## Bottleneck Summary

### Critical (Fix Now): NONE

### Medium Priority:
1. String parsing in draw loops - cache coordinates
2. Magic numbers - convert to constants

### Low Priority:
3. Consider code splitting for maintainability
4. Add performance monitoring for large grids (30x30)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Add helper methods for coordinate parsing
2. ✅ Extract magic numbers to constants
3. ✅ Add comments to complex sections

### Future Considerations:
1. Profile performance on 30x30 grid with many animations
2. Consider object pooling for particles if performance issues arise
3. Add JSDoc comments for all methods

## Conclusion

**Overall Code Quality: GOOD**

The codebase is well-structured with:
- Proper cleanup of temporary data
- Efficient rendering with conditional draws
- Good separation of concerns

Minor optimizations recommended but no critical bottlenecks found.
